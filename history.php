        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>One of the first questions people want to know about is the name, ‘Berean’ and where we got that from.  On November 4, 1960, about a dozen people gathered together to pray about forming a new church.  Over the next few weeks, more people came and within a few weeks 25 people were attending.  The biggest concern of these people was to ensure that this gathering would be centered on studying the Word of God.  With that in mind, they saw the group of people mentioned in Acts 17:10-15 as people with which they wanted to be identified.  The people in Acts met in the town of Berea and were known as people who ‘searched the Scriptures daily’.  Before long there was 100% agreement to begin Berean Baptist Church.</p>
