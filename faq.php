			<div id="info_quad"><h1>What to wear?</h1> 
	<p>We believe that God cares more about what is in our hearts than the clothes we wear (1 Samuel 16:7). There certainly is no dress code. Feel free to dress comfortably - most do.</p>	 </div>
			
			<div id="info_quad"><h1>What to expect?</h1>
	<p>Although we take the worship of God seriously, we don't take ourselves too seriously. We think you will find a welcoming, friendly group of people that will allow you to enjoy the singing and teaching at your level of comfort.  There will be no expectations of you (no "visitors stand up") and there is no need to give when we take the offering.  The service lasts about 75 minutes and is designed to address real life issues from the Bible.</p></div>
			
			<div id="info_quad"><h1>What about my kids?</h1> 
	<p>Berean has great programming for children during the worship gathering and on Wednesday nights (Awana).  We have trained adults who consider it a privilege to teach and minister to your children.</p></div>
			
			<div id="info_quad"><h1>Giving</h1>
	<p>Berean is solely supported by the gifts and donations from people like you.  We are not part of a larger denomination and we do not accept funds from any government programs.  In order for us to reach people in our community, we need resources to pay for the programs, facilities and staff necessary to reach people.</p>  
	<p>Online Giving:  Online giving is a popular method for giving to an organization, but it requires services that cost extra money.  If you are not able to give in person, the most cost efficient way to give is by sending a personal check to the church or using the bill pay option at your bank to give.</p> </div>
