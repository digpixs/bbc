            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Our purpose is simple, we want to Engage Communities to Experience Christ.  What that means is that we want to take what we have already been experiencing from Christ in our lives and share that with those around us.  We have seen how God reveals Himself to us and changes us through the Bible, and so we highly value the Bible.</p>
