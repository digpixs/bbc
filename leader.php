            <h2><a href="about.php">Pastor Bill Dilworth</a></h2><p>- Senior Pastor<p>
				<!-- <p>I grew up in a Pastor’s home and have been involved in many ministries in the church. I first knew that God wanted me to be a Pastor when I was 9 years old. I went to Baptist Bible College to prepare for ministry, and it was there that I met my wife Melanie. We were married in October of 1994, and God has blessed us with 5 wonderful children. My family and I accepted the call to come to Berean in February of 1998 serving as the Associate Pastor, and in 2005,I transitioned into the Senior Pastor position. My heart’s desire is to worship the Lord with people of different cultures and different generations, and be united by the infinite love of Christ.</p>-->

				<h2><a href="about.php">Rebecca Escher</a></h2><p>- Church Administrator<p>
				<!--  <p>As the real power behind the pulpit, Rebecca has proved over and over that without her the whole place would fall apart. With a nack for organizing and arranging events, she single handily keeps Pastor Bill on track.  If not, his messages would be about 5 minutes long and mostly consist of him saying "um" and looking at his feet.</p>-->
