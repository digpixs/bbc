        <h1>I'm New</h1>
            <p>Walking into any church for the first time can be a little awkward.  Hopefully, we can make it a little easier with the information we've provided on this website.  We would be honored to have you visit us this Sunday!</p>

        <h1>What to Expect</h1>
            <p>We think that coming to church should be a good experience!  Although we take the worship of God seriously, we don't take ourselves too seriously.  At Berean, you will find a welcoming, friendly group of people that enjoy worshipping God and discovering life-changing truths from the Bible.  The service starts at 10:30am and lasts about 75 minutes.</p>

    <div id="info_block">
        <h1>What to Wear</h1>
            <p>Berean's style is casual.  We believe that God cares more about what is in our hearts than the clothes we wear.   Some people feel comfortable in a suit or dress while others are comfortable in jeans and a t-shirt. </p>

        <h1>What's For Kids</h1>            
        <p><span>Nursery</span> is provided during the service for children up to 3 years old.</p></br> 
            <p><span>KIDS KOVE</span> is for ages 4 thru 6th grade.  We want kids to learn about God in a fun and exciting way.  Families get to come to the Worship Gathering together and after the song service, the kids go to the KIDS KOVE where they build friendships and learn about God in a way that is appropriate for them.  We value safety, so all of our volunteers have been trained to work effectively with kids as well as had a background check.</p>

        <h1>Teens</h1>
            <p>Berean Student Ministry is an extension of Berean Baptist Church in the Southern New Jersey area. We are committed to engaging 7th-12th grade students to experience Christ through Bible lessons, small group discussions, one-on-one conversations and purposeful events. We will use these tools to expose them to the incredible gospel of Jesus, teach them how it affects every aspect of their daily lives, and send them to reach their friends with it. Though these are good goals, we also want to be very careful to support and encourage the parents instead of replacing them in their efforts to teach their children what it is to be loved by God and to live for Him as a result.</p>
