				<div id="info_tri"><h2>Emotionally Healthy Spirituality</h2><h2>Sundays After Service</h2><p>It’s a simple truth, but one that trips up believers everywhere: You can’t be healthy spiritually if you’re unhealthy emotionally. Join us on this journey, as we take a close look at what it means to break free from bondage to the past and experience true emotional healing.</p>

		    <div id="info_tri"><h2>Ladies Class</h2><h2>Tuesdays 6:00 - 7:30</h2><p>The journey begins in a very private place-your thoughts. When I fail at something, I feel lousy about myself. When others don’t approve of me, I can’t seem to get over it. Sometimes it feels like I’ll never measure up. These are the universal lies that trigger the cycle of self-doubt, robbing you of joyful living.  Now, you can free yourself from these self-defeating lies.</p>
		    </div>

		    <div id="info_tri"><h2>Life Lessons</h2><h2>Wednesdays 7:00 - 8:30 </h2><p>In this group, we will be discussing different lessons we have learned along the way and how biblical principles can guide us through them.</p>

				<p><span>KIDS KOVE</span> is for ages 4 thru 6th grade.  We want kids to learn about God in a fun and exciting way.  Families get to come to the Worship Gathering together and after the song service, the kids go to the KIDS KOVE where they build friendships and learn about God in a way that is appropriate for them.  We value safety, so all of our volunteers have been trained to work effectively with kids as well as had a background check.</p>
